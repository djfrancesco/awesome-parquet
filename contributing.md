## Adding something to this awesome list

If you have something awesome to contribute to this awesome list, this is how you do it.

First, ensure that your addition meets the following criteria:

- Only awesome items. Awesome lists are curations of the best, not everything.
- Does not contain items that are unmaintained, has archived repo, deprecated, or missing docs.
- Entries have a description, unless the title is descriptive enough by itself. It rarely is though.
- The description is concise and informative, not just a link to the project.
- The description is in the same language as the title.
- The link and description are separated by a dash. Example: - [AVA](â€¦) - JavaScript test runner.
- The description starts with an uppercase character and ends with a period.
- Consistent and correct naming. For example, Node.js, not NodeJS or node.js.
